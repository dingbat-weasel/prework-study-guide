        <h2>HTML</h2>
        
        <p>Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is used to create the structure of a webpage. It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</p>
        
        <p>The following element types are commonly used to add content to pages:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Text elements</li>
          <li>Image elements</li>
          <li>Header elements</li>
          <li>List elements</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here are some common element types that are used to divide and describe a page:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Meta-related elements</li>
          <li>Content division elements</li>
          <li>Semantic elements</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In <b>semantic HTML elements</b>, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage. When possible, it is important to use semantic HTML elements, because they make your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser. Semantic HTML also plays an important role in making sure your webpage is accessible to the widest variety of users, including those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers.</p>

        <h3>Each HTML element performs a unique role.</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>The &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; declaration is letting the browser know to expect HTML on the page.</li>
          <li>The &lt;html&gt; opening tag represents the root, or start, of our HTML document.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element. For example, within the &lt;html&gt; tag is an attribute of `lang="en"`, which tells the browser the language for the webpage.</p>
        
        <h3><b>Head</b></h3>

        <p>The &lt;head&gt; element contains the metadata for our web application. <b>Metadata</b> is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users. Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.</p>
        <p>Inside the &lt;head&gt; element, we can use the following metadata tags:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The &lt;title&gt; element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
          <li>The &lt;style&gt; element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The &lt;base&gt; element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The &lt;link&gt; element connects an external resource to the HTML doc.</li>
          <li>The &lt;meta&gt; element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport. Related resource: <html>https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp</html></li>
          <li>The &lt;script&gt; element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><b>Body</b></h3>

        <p>The &lt;body&gt; element defines the body of the document, which contains the content that is visible to the user. All of the content that we want to display to users must be inside the &lt;body&gt; element.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The &lt;h1&gt;,&lt;h2&gt;,&lt;h3&gt;,&lt;h4&gt;,&lt;h5&gt;, and &lt;h6&gt; elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents. Headings are exactly what they sound like: larger or more prominent titles and subtitles to organize a page. When using headings, it is important that we use heading tags in order from 1 to 6 to make the page accessible to users who access the page using screen readers or other devices. In addition, the biggest heading, &lt;h1&gt;, should only appear once on each page.</li>
          <li>The &lt;p&gt; element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>The &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, and &lt;li&gt; elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists.</li>
          <li>The &lt;img&gt; element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The &lt;img&gt; element can contain various attributes; the `src` attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image. The `alt` attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image. The alt text is important for screen readers and other assistive technologies. Alt text can also improve search engine rankings for your website.</li>
          <li>The &lt;br&gt; element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>The &lt;a&gt; element (which stands for <b>anchor</b>) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The `href` attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
          <li>&lt;section&gt; elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>
          <li>The &lt;footer&gt; appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation</li>
        </ul>
