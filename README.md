# Pre-work Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage was created for the UW Coding Bootcamp Pre-Work and operates as a location to store some basic notes from my study of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. While the content is rudimentary, the form of the site itself has functioned as a way for me to learn the above topics.

## Usage

The study guide can be used by viewing the site and reading the notes posted under the HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript headings. In addition to this, upon opening the DevTools console, you can view a list of the topics covered and a suggestion for what you should begin studying first.
